### Attention!
<strong> Iâ€™m not an expert and 3D printing is just my hobby. So please be careful when you build this mod and donâ€™t just go ahead. All parts are tested and working. But everybody bears the risks of a modification him/herself! I'm not responsible if any harm occurs, so be careful, especially with the knife! </strong>

## EREC

This is a simple filament cutter for the awesome ERCF so tip tuning is less important.

It's made out of a Servo and a scalpell/exacto knife blade. The cutter get's mouted to the selector chart just behind the encoder - the cutter is basically an arm that swings to the left and right. Since the ECAS sits now on the Arm the filament path can be opened by swining the arm to the side. Then the ERCF can feed some filament mid air (*the filament tip*) and when the arm swings back to close the filament path the tip gets cut off by the knife on the arm. The cut off tip just falls off to the ground and the filament can be loaded with a clean tip the next time.

#### Why?
I never thought about a filament cutter untill I saw the [Filametrix](https://github.com/sorted01/Filametrix) design / got it recommended. Since I'm not using the ERCF with a Stealthburner (for now at least) I would have to make a cutter on my own. At the same time u/[BioKeks](https://github.com/BioCookieYT) requested a cutter for my Ender 3 fan duct ([Frankenstein 2.0](https://github.com/kevinakasam/FrankEnstein-Duct/tree/main/Frank2.0_Beta)) and that way I though we need something universial. After some days of tinkering this was the result - first with the MG90s servo, but that was so weak it was far aways from cutting it. So long speech short, thanks to [sorted01](https://github.com/sorted01) for the idea with the cutter!

#### Current Status
Considering my other ongoing [projects](https://kevinakasam.com/), Iâ€™ve decided to appoint u/[BioKeks](https://github.com/BioCookieYT) as the new primary contributor to this project. Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™m not completely stepping away, but if you have any questions, feel free to ask u/[BioKeks](https://github.com/BioCookieYT).![](Images/Render.png)



### BOM

| Qty | Part | Description                                                                                                                                                                      
| --- | --- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | [Servo MR996](https://amzn.eu/d/gEQACnZ) | That's just the servo I use, nothing special. But the MG90S are definetly too weak. 60Â° may work, but I highly recommend getting at least a 90Â° servo.   Also check the torque, u/[BioKeks](https://github.com/BioCookieYT) was't able to cut soft PLA with a 12kg.cm servo
| 1 | [Exacto knife blade No. 11](https://amzn.eu/d/0ZmUXIy) | That's just an example so you know the shape/type. I didn't test these! A higher quality blade probably last longer.                                                             |
| 1 | 5V buck converter | The Servo can take quite a lot of current, enough to shut down my ERCF board. If you have the same problem try a buck converter wired to the PSU or use your dedicated 5V PSU    |
| ... | ... | I will add more later but it's just some screws, inserts and washers                                                                                                             |



## Firmware

EREC uses the awesome Happy Hare firmware for the ERCF. I'm sure this also works with the stock macros, but I haven't tried that. In addition, the Happy Hare <code>[mmu_servo]</code> works a lot better than the stock <code>[servo]</code> from Klipper.
